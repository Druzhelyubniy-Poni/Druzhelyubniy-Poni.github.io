			<p><h1>The Cats</h1></p>
			<p>Babels of blocks to the high heavens tow’ring,<br />Flames of futility swirling below;<br />Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flow’ring,<br />Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.<br /><br />Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,<br />Cobwebs of cable by nameless things spun;<br />Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers<br />Streams of live foetor, that rots in the sun.<br /><br />Colour and splendour, disease and decaying,<br />Shrieking and ringing and scrambling insane,<br />Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying,<br />Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain.<br /><br />Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal,<br />Howling and lean in the glare of the moon,<br />Screaming the future with mouthings infernal,<br />Yelling the burden of Pluto’s red rune.<br /><br />Tall tow’rs and pyramids ivy’d and crumbling,<br />Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber’d streets;<br />Bleak broken bridges o’er rivers whose rumbling<br />Joins with no voice as the thick tide retreats.<br /><br />Belfries that blackly against the moon totter,<br />Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac’d,<br />And living to answer the wind and the water,<br />Only the lean cats that howl in the waste!</p>
